# DynamicCellHeight

One approach to dynamically changing UITableViewCell content and height.

Weird colors are just to help identify the elements during dev.

 - Example A shows a cell with multiple elements, where some elements are shown/hidden by changing a control inside the cell.
 - Example B shows a cell with "Show more" / "Show less" button to expand/contract the number of lines of text displayed.
 - Example C shows a not-so-good varsion of "B" - the animation is not as smooth.
 - Example D shows dynamic sizing of a TableViewCell containing a CollectionView with variable content. Each time you load "D" you will get a random number of cells in the Collection (well, random between 3 and 30... enough to demo).
 - Example E shows one method of showing / hiding a Date Picker as part of a cell.
